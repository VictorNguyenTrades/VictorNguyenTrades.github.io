I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities Computer Science. I will be graduating in the Winter of 2019. I created this website as a place to keep track of my trading experience. Specifically, which stocks I believe to have potential and why I believe that they have potential. I will be keeping track of my trades and I will also make an effort to note my mentality and views on trading. I hope this this website will help me improve my knowledge and experience in trading.
