I'm an undergraduate student at the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities Computer Science. I will be graduating in the Winter of 2019. I created this website as a place to share my projects.

Most of my projects may be viewed on my github account. If it is not on github, feel free to message me and I can see what I can do!

I hope to be putting out a lot more projects soon!
