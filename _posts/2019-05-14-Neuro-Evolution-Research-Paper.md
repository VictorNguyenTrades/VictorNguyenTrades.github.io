This papers focus is using neuroevolution and the NEAT process to create a neural network that is
capable of playing the game Super Mario Bros though the FCEUX emulator. Manipulation of the
bias mutation rate showed that the resulting populations could develop or destroy useful behaviors
that would allow out neural network to get past obstacles quicker. We found that by increasing the
bias mutation rate of our neural network it could more quickly learn these behaviors, however it
also had the potential to mutate away from those behaviors resulting in the neural network going
backwards in progress. In addition when changing the weight mutation rate the result was that
once the neural network learned how to get passed an obstacle it continued to build on the learned
behavior. Some obstacles within Super Mario Bros were difficult for our neural network to pass,
this was associated with our fitness function. we believe modifying the fitness function to introduce
a benefit to individuals who manage to overcome difficult obstacles would be an effective way to
solve this issue.
