Certificate Transparency is an additional mechanism that can be added to the current SSL certificate system to improve the reliability and user trust of certificates. Certificate Transparency has been implemented in some fashion in Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari web browsers. Additionally, gossip protocols can be used with Certificate Transparency to help make the checking of the consistency between certificate logs more efficient. Using a combination of information about Certificate Transparency and gossip protocols, we are able to replicate a certificate log, certificate authority, domain address, and client in order to demonstrate an attack. The attack will exploit a potential weakness in the Certificate Transparency and gossip protocol combination to identify if a given user is gossiping. The gossiping user could then be fed a false certificate or blocked from sharing its gossip with other certificate logs.
